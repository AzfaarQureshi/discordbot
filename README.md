# discordbot

Built in python and uses the Discord API. Initially had capabilities to stream music off of youtube and play it the audio channel of a Discord server, but after I found out that it goes against the Terms & Conditions of YouTube API I had to get rid of the functionality. The Bot can still post customized images directly into the chat stream. Used as a Meme bot amongst friends. This is available for demo on my discord server.
